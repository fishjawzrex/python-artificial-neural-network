# python-artificial neural net
Original network framework developed by Michael Nielson.
I have tried to tune the network by changing the number of layers,
altering the size of each layer, and even normalizing, and re-standardizing the inputs
from the MNIST dataset, but cannot seem to improve the accuracy of the network beyond
1500/10000.
